## About

Created by Super Idol Team as a midterm project for Intro to Internet Technology subject. This web game is made responsive. You can play it on your mobile phone. This game has the following features:<br>

## Game over when

* <strong>Player graduates</strong>

> Player can <b>"WIN"</b> the game by graduating. <b>How to graduate?</b> You have to fill your <b>education bar</b> (the bar under your character) by studying. After you fill the bar, you will complete 1 year of your college study (The graduation hat logo on top right). You will GRADUATE after <b>5 years of your college study.</b> 

* <strong>Player dies</strong>

> Player can <b>"LOSE"</b> the game by dying. <b>How not to die?</b> You have to survive the game by not letting your <b>health bar</b> goes to 0%. To do that, you have to eat, sleep, play at your desired pace. Try to fill the bars that are low so that you can keep on surviving. 

## Start of the game

* Player starts with <b> 50% health, food, energy, and happiness. </b> 

* Player starts with <b> $100 money </b>

* <b> First year </b>of college at UMN

* There is a <b> difficulty increase </b> each time you complete 1 year of college

> So for example. Year 1 of college will be easier than Year 2 and so on and so forth. (Difficulty : Year 5 > Year 4 > Year 3 > Year 2 > Year 1)

## More game instructions

* <strong>Money</strong>

> You need <b>money</b> (cash logo on top right) to <b>buy food</b> for you to eat. The <b>work button</b> will increase your current money in random nominals between <b>$20 to $100</b>. <br> 
>>But on the flip side, working will decrease your sleep and happiness bar, which leads to decrease on health bar too. <strong>PRO TIP : Your money maxes out at $300. So use it wisely</strong>

* <strong>Food Bar</strong>

> If your character currently has 0% food bar, your health bar will decrease at a much faster rate, leading to faster death.

* <strong>Disabled Buttons</strong>

> If some buttons are disabled, that means one or more of your character's bars are low or you run out of money.

## Bug we found

* Background music only plays when you open the website from LIVE SERVER through Visual Studio Code. If you open the website from your local file, the background music won't play.
